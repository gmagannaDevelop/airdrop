I have not yet found a way to find which language is being used for an specific user.

MacOS does not properly set the locale when starting the terminal, i.e. the 
LANG variable is always unset, empty.

Thus airdrop utility script should be adapted to the names of possible users on 
a system and the corresponding menu icon name on the language they are using

Any help on how to solve this issue would be appreciated.
